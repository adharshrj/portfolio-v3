          <p className="py-2 text-[#dcdbdb] font-semibold text-justify">
            I specialize in designing systems, developing Full-Stack web applications and integrated solutions for a given purpose. 
            Iâ€™m a continuous and passionate learner who loves to experiment with state of the art technologies to upskill myself for the market needs.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-[#dcdbdb] font-semibold text-justify">
           I initially started as a Python Developer for AI/ML related projects in 2019. 
           I then took up Java Backend Development and then evolved into a Java Full-Stack Developer with the React, SpringBoot and MySQL stacks. 
           I later picked up the MERN stack and Next.Js based on client requirements. 
           I believe in developing Language and Framework agnostic skills in order to become a good Engineer.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 text-[#dcdbdb] font-semibold text-justify">
           I also have extensive experience with developing solutions on various cloud platforms, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure.
